Thanks !</p><p id="context" style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Context</p><p>Having taken a sabbatical from my job as a data engineer, in a solar manufacturing start-up, I was keen to try my own luck in entrepreneurship. I decided to build a product to solve the problem of wasted human capital on social media (we spend an average of 2hrs on social media, with developing countries spending even more time on these often counter-productive applications). </p><p>The idea for the product, Riples, was to have the same ‚Äúhooks‚Äù and ‚Äúhabit building‚Äù features behind existing social media, merged with project management and collaboration software features to incentivise user collaboration on any kind of projects. The video below is a good explainer:</p> <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lbyVFgKV3Oc?si=eVWZAMk6REtyApGO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> <p>I knew the product I wanted to build, but had multiple options for moving forward (eg. test collaborating on problems to learn the problems, build a mobile app prototype ..). I ended up deciding to build a web-app Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and giving myself clear deadlines with targets, to mitigate the risks of spending all my time for nothing.</p><p> Therefore, after a month of learning web development technology and figuring out other stuff (BM, name and logo‚Ä¶), I applied an agile approach, for the next 3 months (Sept-Nov) with lot‚Äôs of user testing, releases to my network, prioritising features build, gathering and understanding usage data ‚Ä¶ After which (in Dec 23‚Äô), I decided to put this project on the back-burner due to lack of uptake and realising that I wasn‚Äôt passionate enough about social media to spend all my time on this project any more. Below you will find more details on this project: Challenges encountered, What I ended up building, and Lessons learned. </p><p id="interesting-challenges" style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Interesting Challenges</p><p>There was a lot of fun and interesting challenges with building this web-app, from learning new languages and frameworks like React and Typescript, entrepeunarial challenges like finding the right thing to build or even finding a name and designing a logo. However, there is a lot of tutorials and ressource to help me solve those, so instead I want to highlight 2 AI related challenges I encoutered, as these were novel. </p><p> <strong> 1 - Building an interface with OpenAI‚Äôs API for actions and actions approval:</strong> </p><p> Actions were a new feature introduced in OpenAI‚Äôs first developer day (6/11/23), where the LLM process user input and have the ability to call functions with parameters.  So I wanted Riples‚Äô users to be able to streamline a bunch of their project management task (eg. Move all tasks related to project X to backlog and update the description to explain it is deprioritised).  This was really fun and challenging because it involved back and forth logic between the client / server and OpenAI APIs. Below is a diagram showcasing what I came up with in a first solution iteration </p><div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <img src="https://t3-portofolio.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/OpenAILucid.png" alt="OpenAI API Interface" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image">    <p style="font-style: italic;">OpenAI API Client/Server/API Interface diagram to allow user approval on actions on Riples. You can left click on the image for better resolution. </p>  </div></div><p > <strong> 2 - Building a Wizard, like ‚ÄúClippy‚Äù in Excel  </strong> </p><p> I build a ‚Äúwizard‚Äù, which was an overlay button that would always be in the bottom left corner of the web-app that the user could interact with for AI interactions. depending on which page it was opened could:</p><ul>  <li>Chat with the user (back and forth) with for example information about a project</li> <li>Onboard the user, with helpers and checkers for certain tasks validations (eg. help the user create a project and display (left screenshot below)</li> <li>Create content for the user based on other entries (eg. breakdown a project into tasks - middle screenshot below)</li><li>Transform raw text into custom HTML (with headings, fonts, pictures, text formatting ‚Ä¶). The idea was to allow more creativity in posts by having an AI generate HTLM rich content based on text.</li></ul><div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <img src="https://t3-portofolio.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/RiplesWizardScreens.png" alt="Riples‚Äô Wizard Variations" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image">    <p style="font-style: italic;">Different variations of the Riples‚Äô Wizard, depending on which page the user would click the overlay. </p>  </div></div><p id="what-i-ended-up-building" style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">What I ended up building</p><p>After three months, I was very far from reaching my targets (20 registered users vs a goal of a 1000 - people could view without logging in but to create they had to log-in), so I decided to shift my focus to another project (also, I was less enthusiastic about building a social media). In the end, I had build a web-app, where any user could:</p><p><strong>Social Features:</strong></p><ul>  <li>Sign-up and authenticate via email or third party service providers (Github, Google, Linkedin)</li>  <li>See a feed of project updates from other users (no machine learning recommendation)</li>  <li>Like & Comment on these updates</li>  <li>Receive notifications based on likes and comments on their posts</li></ul><p><strong>Project Management Feature:</strong></p><ul>  <li>Create and manage projects with different visibility (private/public) and collaboration (solo/collab) settings</li>  <li>Create and manage Tasks linked to projects</li>  <li>Create and manage SubTasks linked to Tasks</li>  <li>Manage task and project accessibility for collaborative projects</li>  <li>Upload photos to their project cover and project posts</li>  <li>Manage and post updates on goals attached to projects</li></ul><p>And these were also complemented by quite a lot of AI features. Hopefully, Riples is still live on <a href="https://www.riples.app/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">www.riples.app</a> for you to check it out and give me feedback on it üôÇ !</p><div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <img src="https://t3-portofolio.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/ERD.jpg" alt="Riples ERD" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image">    <p style="font-style: italic;">Riples Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).

I lived in Sydney for about 18 months, had amazing flatmates, and worked at a solar start-up called "5B." Life was good. But after four incredible years in Australia, the itch to explore returned.      </p>     <p></br>       Fast-forward to Sunday evening. After bidding adieu to my friends with a pretty hilarious hippy-themed farewell party, we gathered for one final dinner with my flatmates. Leaving behind the warm memories we created in our Maroubra "House of the Rising Sun," I hit the road. First stop: Canberra, a mere three hours south of Sydney, where I slept before making my way to Geelong to catch a ferry to Tasmania the next day.     </p></br>      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">       <div style="text-align: center;">         <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/day1-1.jpeg" alt="Parliament House" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"  class="responsive-image" >         <p style="font-style: italic;">Sunrise on the Parliament House, Canberra</p>       </div>     </div style="text-align: center;">     <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">       <div>         <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/day1-2.jpeg" alt="Mavericks" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"  class="responsive-image" >         <p style="font-style: italic;">Finding 'Mavericks' 5B solar products at a random petrol station en route to Geelong</p>       </div>     </div>      <p></br>     The real fun began once I reached Tasmania. With no fixed itinerary and after seeing a pretty flat surf forecast, I decided to slowly make my way down the east coast of Tassie, without any specific destinations. The first few days are therefore spent driving, searching for waves in places like Scamander, hiking, and coding (this <a href="https://www.riples.app/about/riples" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">Riples</a> web-app you are reading this on).      </p></br>      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">       <div style="text-align: center;">         <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/day2-1.jpeg" alt="Freycinet" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"  class="responsive-image" >         <p style="font-style: italic;">A Trail that stood out, Freycinet Park</p>       </div>     </div style="text-align: center;">     <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">       <div>         <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/day2-2.jpeg" alt="Car setup" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"  class="responsive-image" >         <p style="font-style: italic;">First-person view of the car setup, in Scamander</p>       </div>      </div>      <p>       I ended up making my way down, quite quickly, as I saw there was a bit of swell hitting Bruny Island, an hour's drive from Hobart, Tasmania's largest city. There, in Cloudy Bay, a surf spot on the south of the island, I managed to get my first good surf in ! Apparently it's the southernmost surf spot of Tasmania, and therefore Australia, so even with the neoprene hood, booties, and gloves on top of my old 4/3 wetsuit, it was still fresh!          </p></br>      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">       <div style="text-align: center;">         <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/day3-1.jpeg" alt="Bruny-surf" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"  class="responsive-image" >         <p style="font-style: italic;"> Uncrowded Surf in Cloudy Bay, Bruny Island </p>       </div>     </div style="text-align: center;">     <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">       <div>       <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/day3-2.jpeg" alt="Bruny-view" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"  class="responsive-image" >       <p style="font-style: italic;"> View of Adventure Bay, Bruny Island </p>       </div>      </div>      <p></br>       I really enjoyed my time on Bruny, and ended up staying 3 nights until I had to make my way to Port Arthur for a 4-day hike, called "Three Capes", which I had pre-booked. The journey was nothing short of remarkable, offering awe-inspiring views and a newfound appreciation for‚Äîwait for it‚Äîrocks. At the start of the hike, they funnily said: "Well you are all here to see rocks".

I'll give a few personal examples:     </p></br>      <p>       <li> Booking the "Three Capes Hike" on a whim a couple of weeks before leaving for Tassie. Turned out to be the best part + got a 100$ discount a couple of days <b>after booking!</b> It also got me doing a lot of amazing hikes prepping for this one</li>       <li> Met a nurse in a hostel that had been to this "Baker Street festival", which was nearly finished. There was one more event the next weekend which I went to by myself. Turned out to be beautiful music + stargazing with a lot of hobbyist astronomers with great gear, and I continued admiring the dark Tassie sky for the rest of the trip.</li>       <li> Changed course on my planned hike of Mount Wellington and arrived at the top exactly when it cleared up (+ got to see the snow which made me think of home) </li>     </p>      <p><br/>     The point of these examples is not to show that by some magic because I took unexpected decisions I was rewarded, but rather that by listening to an inner voice I opened up the field of opportunities. And the fact that these were quite outside of my "normal" opens up even more opportunities!      Anyway I think you get the idea, and to put things in perspective, I will acknowledge that at the NOCTURNA festival, it started with 2 hrs of pretty average scientific talks and I nearly left !)     </p><br/>      <p style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold;"> Conclusion </p>          <p><br/>     From the lakes framed by mountainous backdrops to the countless hiking trails and beautiful skies, Tasmania has been an absolute blast (even though I was pretty unlucky with the surf). I would like to finish up with a call to action for you: try to follow your heart on something(s) these next few weeks. The more out of the ordinary the better !      </p><br/>      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">       <div>       <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/day6-1.jpeg" alt="Thouruoghly enjoying rocks" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"  class="responsive-image" >       <p style="font-style: italic;"> A photo of me thoroughly enjoying rocks :) </p>       </div>     </div>      <p><br/>     PS: Doing a blog post like this is definitly out of my comfort zone / style, and mainly just to showcase the idea of sharing projects on Riples.

This time around, we will be crossing two more Australian states together, but with a lot more driving involved, as you can probably tell by the map below: </p></br>  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">   <div style="text-align: center;">     <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/day14-1.jpeg" alt="Map of the journey" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image">     <p style="font-style: italic;">The approximate travel itinerary, the orange lines represent the journey from this Riple.</p>   </div> </div> </br>   <p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">  Show Time ! </p>  <p>     I timed the ferry to return me to the mainland with enough spare time to catch some waves and wake those legs up, before having to drive to Lorne (just an hour away). I had booked myself on a trail race about three months back, while planning this trip. Why ? Since my first marathon in Sydney about a year ago, I've been loving endurance sports and trying few different ones to find out which I liked best (my fav so far is the triathlon ! ) </p>   </br>   <p>     The race was a 50km trail, featuring a ridiculous number of waterfalls and river crossings‚Äîas high as knee-deep sometimes. It‚Äôs pretty weird running with wet sock, but they actually dry out pretty fast, and there is no way around ! No music for the first half; just me, the trail, and the sound of rushing water. What threw me for a loop was the massive climb around the 40k mark. The way up, probably around 500 meters, was actually fine because I just walked it ‚Äî but it turned into a death run for my legs on the way down. Plus the race organizers gifted us a few kms. Advertised as a 50km, it turned out to be a bonus 5km, a good old 10% reverse discount :) </p>  </br>  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">       <div style="text-align: center;">     <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/day14-2.jpeg" alt="Crossing the finish line after 7.5 hours" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image"/>  <p style="font-style: italic;"> Crossing the finish line after 7.5 hrs of stumbling on rocky river beds, walking and some running </p>  	</div>  </div>   </br>   <p>     After barely surviving the race, I reconnected with my friend Casey, a local shaper I met during an unforgettable surf trip in Hawaii four years ago. Check out his work at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/braesurfboards/" target="_blank"  style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">braesurfboards on Instagram</a>. With the waves firing, I fought my heavy legs, and we got amongst it ( I reckon the cold water helped recovery !!). Oh, and post-surf saunas? Absolutely incredible.   </p>   </br> <p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;"> Crossing the Nullarbor! </p>     <p>     Life was good in Victoria, but as I wanted to make my way to Margaret River pretty fast, I left after a couple of magical days. En route, I encountered some astonishingly remote surf spots, learning locals in South Australia don't think twice about driving hours for a good wave. No surf photos to share though, as I got too excited and jumped straight in every time (and the spots are often quite a bit of a paddle away). Instead, enjoy this one:   </p>  </br>   <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">       <div style="text-align: center;">  <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/day14-4.jpeg" alt=‚ÄúKangaroo‚Äù style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image"/><p style="font-style: italic;"> Not a bad lifestyle ! Kangoos chilling around Halls Gap, between Melbourne and Adelaide </p>  </div> </div>   </br>   <p>     With the last famous surf spot, ‚ÄúCactus‚Äù taking me right to the beginning of the infamous Nullarbor road, I got a few good last sessions in before the long drive. The Nullarbor is fascinatingly barren; the name literally means "no trees," although you'll find a few stubborn ones.

It‚Äôs called consistency, and done well, it will work wonders (not unlike compounding money in the bank, with the current interest rates). The core idea is simple, doing something over and over again, you get really good at it, and progress will stack up eventually. This is what allowed me to run the trail in Lorne ( ie. consistently running in zone 2 for a year, mind you never more than 20k).    </p><p>     The secret is in the how you do it, especially for things you might enjoy less, like writing this blog for me ;). The key is to turn the desired action (eg. Writing) into a habit. My top three tips for this are: </p> <p><li> üìÖ Schedule it with reminders (eg. every second Sunday, alarm and notifications to write and post a blog). </li> <li> üëÅÔ∏è Have a visual cue for the habit ( eg. every time I am coding this app I see my last blog post, and I am reminded I better start thinking about what to write next). </il> <li> üó£Ô∏è Tell your friends about it to have social accountability. ( I have told a few of my friends I will keep writing this !) </li> </p> </br> <p>You get the idea, but if you want to dive deeper, I recommend James Clear‚Äôs book ‚ÄúAtomic Habit‚Äù. On this note, get out there, and let‚Äôs all compound together :)</p>,
        <p id="western-australia-waters" style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Western Australia Waters</p> <p>     For this last leg of the Oz road trip, I had designated 3 weeks around the Margaret River area. Indeed, since I first stepped foot in Australia, I've dreamt of surfing here, and it was worth kind of rushing the first part of the journey ! </p><br>  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">     <div style="text-align: center;">         <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/part3-0.jpeg" alt="Map of Australia Adventures" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image">         <p style="font-style: italic;">The approximate travel itinerary, the orange lines represent the journey from this Riple.</p>     </div> </div><br>  <p>      From Denmark to Margaret River, think of vast, uninterrupted beaches with myriad options. The picturesque Gracetown and the iconic Mainbreak at Margaret River were clear highlights. I still can't wrap my head around the fact that I got to surf the renowned Mainbreak with fewer than 10 people on more than one occasion (even if it might have been better elsewhere). </p> <br>  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">     <div style="text-align: center;">         <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/part3-1.jpeg" alt="Mainbreak showing off, Margaret River WA"  style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image">         <p style="font-style: italic;">Mainbreak, Margaret River</p> 	<br>         <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/part3-2.jpeg" alt="North Point doing it‚Äôs thing, Margaret River WA"  style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image">         <p style="font-style: italic;">North Point, Margaret River</p>     </div> </div> <br>  <p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Creating on the road</p> <p>     Aside from surfing, I have been working on Riples way more than the previous month. When asked if I feel like I'm missing out on my trip, my answer has layers. True, I could explore more if solely dedicated to travel, but it‚Äôs also super fun to combine working and travelling. You get to see cool places before and after 9-5 working sessions, and with the freedom to tailor my schedule around the surf and weather, I never feel like I am missing out. Apart from the kind of subpar work setup (cramped in the back of the car, or libraries), I have nothing to complain about !</p> <br> <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">     <div style="text-align: center;">         <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/part3-3.jpeg" alt="Man's best rock friend, Albany WA" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image">         <p style="font-style: italic;">Man's best rock friend, next to Laundromat in Albany WA (yes, I also have to do my chores ‚Ä¶)</p><br>        <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/part3-4.jpeg" alt="Hike view" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image">         <p style="font-style: italic;">Should I work from here?

Firstly, I shared a first version of Riples, and that got me super excited at first, but then left me in the ‚ÄúTrough of Sorrow‚Äù. But adversity fuels me, whether in sports, learning, or other pursuits (also to balance emotional swings, I can‚Äôt recommend meditation enough). So I got a massive boost of energy and determination, from the feeling that the Riples start-up idea is an impossible mission (and it may well be !).  </p><br>  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">     <div style="text-align: center;">         <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/part3-5.jpeg" alt="YC peak and trough startup" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image">         <p style="font-style: italic;">Paul Graham‚Äôs startup curve concept</p>     </div> </div><br>  <p>     Secondly, Ideas are powerful and that this one is taking me for a ride. I am super excited with the numerous facets of Riples project hosting concept, always eager to build and shape it further, always refining the Idea. So much so that in my final two weeks in Australia, almost everything took a backseat to surfing and Riples, even selling my car and planning my subsequent Indonesia adventure (all those side things turned out allright in the end !). Also, a side observation: I'm discerning striking parallels between entrepreneurship and creative endeavours (creating something people enjoy, thinking outside the box‚Ä¶) </p><br>  <p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Just in time reading</p> <p>     In the previous Riple, I delved into the wonders of habits. Among all, reading holds a special place for me (shoutout to Goodreads for being a stellar reading list app). Lately, I've adopted a different approach to reading, termed by others as ‚ÄúJust in time reading". The crux is to synchronize your reading choices with your predominant thoughts at the moment. Contemplating travel? Dive into Sylvain Tesson's writings. Deciphering marketing for disruptive products? "Crossing the Chasm" by Geoffrey Moore awaits. If you're in my shoes, building a consumer product that needs regular users, "Hooked" by Eyal Nir is a must-read. </p><br>  <p> Ready to continue our adventure? Our next stop: Indonesia. Until then, ride the wave of inspiration and keep exploring! </p>

I rented a scooter, and after checking three hostels/homestays, the fourth one had availability for a night.

The traffic on these densely populated islands, coupled with overtaking trucks and potholes, kept me constantly alert. On the way to Sumbawa, after discussing with Nik, I chose to surf Desert Point during the peak of the swell. On the first day, I needed to navigate to this remote location, about a two-hour scooter ride from the ferry. To add to the adventure, the ferry, delayed by the swell, arrived at sunset. This meant I had to tackle the treacherous road to the Desert at night with my heavily laden 100cc Honda Scooby.

        <p id="south-india" style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;"> A month in South India</p><h3> A spicy journey</h3><p>Arriving to India at midnight was propably not the smartest idea I ever had. As I was to find out, not everything is as easy and tourist friendly in India, as it was in the other South East Asia countries I was coming from. So after a long travel day from Cambodia, in a run-down, freshly repainted taxi, I started to wonder what exactly I was doing here.&nbsp;Most of the people I have met since had a similar experience in their first couple of days in India. The culture is so different, and the poverty so striking, that it shocks and shakes you. And you could say I had it easy, Chennai, where I landed, might not be the prettiest or most exciting city in India, but it&#39;s definitly not as poor as Dehli, where most tourist land. Nonetheless, I am certain I will remember my first day in India forever, as you'll see.</p><div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="https://t3-portofolio.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/proj-travel-2024/India-01.jpg" style="float:right; height:305px; margin-left:20px; margin-right:20px; width:229px" /></div><p> Waking up to my first light in India, I had 3 missions for the day: get some Roupees, a SIM card and get out of Chennai. Only crossing a few sleeping cows and people on the street in front of my hostel at 08 AM, I realised the city was still sleeping. Indians are not early risers. Yet, I managed to get money out on the 3rd ATM I tried, and found a small restaurant for breakfast on way back. After ordering practically at random due to language barriers, I was sat on a table with 3 other customers, which is, as I would found out, both customary and practical. Turns out that I ordered a Masala Dosa, a popular crepe-like south Indian breakfast dish, filled with potato and delicious spices! It brought back some excitement and energy. </p> <p> Not long after, I was back at the hotel, sitting in the staircase between the 4th and 5th floors, to use the wifi. I was on a mission to accomplish my other goals: get a SIM card and then get out of Chennai.</p><p>To kill two birds with one stone, I grabbed my backpack and took a local train from Chennai's beach districit to the nearby Eggmore district. Here, not only was one of the few Airtel stores open on a Sunday, but it was also a location from where I could catch a train out of Chennai. I got the SIM card after about an hour of questions, such as my &quot;reference contact in India&quot;. Finaly armed with an internet connection, I was confident it was going to be a piece of cake to get to Pondicherry. </p>  <p> Arriving at the train platform just 15 minutes before the train was set to depart turned out to be a significant error on my part. I quickly discovered that the train was already packed, with large crowds gathered at the doors of the red unreserved coaches‚Äîthe ones for which I had tickets.</p><p> In those frantic 15 minutes, I pushed, ran, and shouted, yet it seemed impossible to board, particularly burdened with my large backpack. I started to consider that I was not going to make this train, but, so desperate to get away from this city, I pushed harder. Some guy pointed to the nearby blue coaches, implicitly telling me to try my luck cheating on the upper class coaches, and he was right I was never making it in here. With only a few minutes left, I found a door with only 4 people outside, and elbowed my way in.</p> <p> Beginning the 3 hours train ride I managed to find a sweet spot near toilets, with my bag under a sink, and about three people resting on me. But, Eggmore was only the first station and in the next 30 minutes we stopped twice more, and I watched unbelievingly crowds of people pushing in every-time.&nbsp;Luckily, the next train was the complete opposite, nearly empty, and having met some friendly cyclist from Ponducherry on the empty platform, a pleasant ride. They explained to me, that it was Pongal holiday on Monday and that the trains where so busy because people where going back home for the holidays. And that was my first day in India.</p>

        <p> My first stop afte Chennai was Pondicherry, and day by day I started loving this country more. Noticing more and more difference in this culture like boys holding hands walking in the streets. What's really incredible about India it's because of it's sheer population, even in the touristy destinationation lie Pondicherry, an ancient French colony, there are way more indians than foreigners. And that's so cool because it makes less western culture, and you get to see more traditional . First exposure to the photoshoot scenes that can get quiet funny but it's serious buiseness for them

        <p id="context" style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Project Context</p><p>Working for a manufacturing solar start-up (~200 employees), I pitched and then executed the development of a data warehouse (technically more a central database than a data warehouse) to store & leverage business and product data from factory to field, for two distinct business cases.</p><p>The project entailed creating data pipelines from 5B‚Äôs Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software (Odoo), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software (Salesforce), as well as project planning, and field reporting software into Amazon Web Services (AWS). After the daily Extract Transform Load (ETL) pipelines to S3, the data was stored in a single PostgreSQL database and served to customers (internal only) via dashboards, reports, and SQL queries access for more in-depth data analysis.</p><p id="context" style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Challenges</p><p>This project wasn‚Äôt without its challenges. For example, to understand and query the ERP data effectively was tough, as we were using Odoo, an open-source ERP, with a lot of customization. For example, I remember struggling for a while on SQL queries to link each component of a 4 level BoM to Purchase Orders and Transfer Orders, through inventories and Production Orders (to have supplier traceability through individual products).</p><p>Another challenge was that I had to wear a lot of different hats on this project, such as doing database architecture, data analysis for reports and dashboards, cloud and data engineering to setup AWS and various pipelines, all tasks I wasn‚Äôt familiar with, while managing and teaching an intern. The way I solved this challenge, was to make clear to all stakeholders that this project was a POC, maintaining a constant bi-monthly schedule for releases, and reaching out to other employees about any similar experience they might have had.</p><p id="context" style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Project Outcome</p><p>In the end, after 6 months of work (at 50% FTE) from myself, and a skilled intern on this Proof of Concept (POC), the data didn't have clear business repercussions (apart from revealing and solving a few mistakes earlier than if we hadn't done the project), but clearly set in motion a more data driven culture. Indeed, the entire company was aware of the project as dashboards were projected on the walls of the office, and we got many requests for integrating and reporting on other data streams as well as building customer facing data products. In the end, the product leaders decided to continue this project and I helped hire a replacement for my role that could build valuable products on top of this initial data infrastructure. </p>

        <p> After changing roles from a Business Analyst to a Data Engineer at 5B, a solar array manufacturing start-up, I pitched and build multiple projects. The one I started with, was integrating our engineering and supply chain databases (Entreprise Resource Planning (ERP) <> Computer Aided Design (CAD) Software integration). The aim of the project was to: <ol><li> Reduce Engineering to Order (ETO) Time by 5-10%. </li> <li> Reduce manufacturing downtime and sourcing costs due to human error in cross-referencing 50+ products for each new product configuration. </li> <li> Change from an ETO process relying on technical knowledge (Production Lead) to a scalable systematised ETO. </li></ol> </p>  <p> The results was custom software with Google Apps Script, allowing users to import data from both databases into google drive, compare product meta data and build an importable ERP Bill of Material (BoM) from the CAD BoM. You can find below a product demo: </p> <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DsvPQG2PCvY?si=DTTTrK-yF9C_enLd" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> <p> While the efficiency and error reduction targets where achieved, this product failed to fully systematise the CAD <> ERP process ETO. Indeed, it still required expertise to run the Google Script, and I ended up handing it off to my replacement. Finally, In the research phase before deciding to build our own, I found this SolidWorks <> Odoo ERP Integration tool that was pretty similar to what I ended up building, which would be an alternative to in house code software to solve this problem (specifically for Solidwords <> Odoo) :  </p> <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v4Y5CS_EJ_0?si=w99PtVT5YpfY2Kdr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div>

        <p> As I was doing my master's in Solar Energy at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney, I became increasingly interested in Agriphotovoltaic (APV). APV is combination of using solar panels to transform the sun's energy into electricity, as well as plants for chemical energy. Multiple synergies had already been proven in this field, but I was interested in the synergies that semi-transparent solar cells could bring to APV. </p> <div style="text-align: center;"> <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BlY7BPrw3y0KqKGF8WYg3WazDnGyPFAa/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe> </div> <p> Challenge was finding the right software to model everyhting. Paper is not that interesting but the methodology was novel so we decided to publish (the idea had already been explored in 2-3 papers - but never with a modelling methodology)

        full_text: `
        <p>During my final year at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), I worked part-time as a residential rooft-top solar system designer for a solar installer. My primary responsibility involved creating Single Line Diagrams (SLD) tailored to each house, using information provided by our sales team and various product specifications. After manually designing numerous SLDs and gaining a deep understanding of their mechanics, I began to automate the process.</p>
        <p>Initially, I developed Excel templates featuring pre-filled formulas for calculations like voltage. I also introduced a main page in these templates, incorporating parameters and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) functions. These functions helped in selecting the appropriate template for each job and removing unnecessary geometrical shapes (eg. templates had 3 phase as default but if single phase house it would delete 2 phases from SLD).</p>
        <p>Eventually, after creating numerous templates, I developed a user interface (UI) using Python and Tkinter. This UI included a comprehensive product database in JSON format and several advanced features, such as the ability to save projects, retrieve job information from our CRM APIs, and generate PDFs. You can view the final result in the video below:</p>

        <p>In this first big coding project, I not only enhanced my existing Python skills (previously applied in a high-school project to develop a Snake game) but also acquired new competencies in GitHub versioning, Excel VBA, packaging python for desktop application and Bash for file. Creating this software not only expanded my skill set, but also reduced the time required to create a single SLD, from 2 hours to just 5-10 minutes. This efficiency gain enabled me to learn about and contribute to commercial solar projects at my workplace.</p>
