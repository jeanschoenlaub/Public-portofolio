<h2>A month in South India</h2><h3>The first day</h3><p>Arriving to India at midnight was propably not the smartest idea I ever had. As I was to find out, not everything is as easy and tourist friendly in India, as it was in the other SE Asia country I was coming from. So it was after a long travel day from Cambodia, in a run-down, freshly repainted taxi, that I started to wonder what exactly I was doing here.&nbsp;Most of the people I have met since had a similar experience in their first couple of days in India. The culture is so different, and the poverty so striking, that it shocks and shakes you. And you could say I had it easy, Chennai, where I landed, might not be the prettiest or most exciting city in India, but it&#39;s definitly not as poor as Dehli, where most tourist land. Nonetheless, I am certain I will remember my first day in India for ever.</p><div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="https://t3-portofolio.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/proj-travel-2024/India-01.jpg" style="float:right; height:305px; margin-left:20px; margin-right:20px; width:229px" /><p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 0;">First city cow encounter in Chennai</p></div><p>As I woke up to my first Indian sunrise I had 3 missions for the day: get some Indian Roupees, a SIM card and get out of Chennai. After wandering the dirt streets of the Chennai Beach district, only crossing a few sleeping cows and people, I realised the city was still sleeping. Indians are not early risers. Yet, I managed to get money out on the 3rd ATM I tried, and found a small restaurant for breakfast on way back. Ordering a Masala Dosa, and a coffee, I was first surprised by being sat on a table with 3 other customers. But it was one of the best Dosa, a crepe-like popular south Indian breakfast dish, filled with potato and delicious spices! It brought back some excitement and energy. Soon, I was back at the hotel, sitting in the staircase between floor 4 and 5, to use the wifi to figure out how to accomplish my other missions: SIM card and getting out of Chennai.</p><p>I made a plan that started flawlessly, taking a local train from the beach districit to the nearby Eggmore district, where as one of the few Airtel stores open on Sunday, and a a place where I could take a train out of Chennai. I got the SIM card after about an hour of questions, such as my &quot;reference contact in India&quot;. Finaly armed with an internet connection, I was confident it was going to be a piece of cake to get to Ponducherry. But getting to the train platform 15 minutes before the train departure time, I realised the train was full, with big groups of people amassed by the doors of the unreserved red coaches.</p><p>With my big bagpack, I joined them, pushing hard just to get one feet on the steps. Realising my bag was going to be hanging out a controller told me off and pointed me towards the front of the train. I ran to the unreserved coaches on the other side of the train, only to find them even more full. I started to consider that I was not going to make this train, but, so desperate to get away from this city, I pushed harder. Some guy pointed to the nearby blue coaches, implicitly telling me to try my luck on the upper class coaches, and he was right I was never making it in here. With only a few minutes left I found a door with only 4 people outside, pressed them hard and the people I could see throught the window to make some space. As the train left I got in. And that was only the beginning of the 3 hours train ride adventure. Indeed, Eggmore was the first station and in the next 30 minutes we stopped twice more, with crowds of people pushing in every-time. I ended up pushed against a sink, with my bag under it, near two smelly toilets, and about three people resting on my shouldersfor the rest of the first train leg.&nbsp;Luckily, the next train was the complete opposite, nearly empty, and having met some friendly cyclist from Ponducherry on the empty platform, a pleasant ride. They explained to me, that it was Pongal holiday on Monday and that the trains where so busy because people where going back home for the holidays. And that was my first day in India.</p><div style="text-align: center"><img alt="" src="https://t3-portofolio.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/proj-travel-2024/India-03.gif" style="height:200px; margin-left:20px; margin-right:20px; width:200px" /><img alt="" src="https://t3-portofolio.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/proj-travel-2024/India-02.png" style="height:200px; margin-left:20px; margin-right:20px" /></div><p><span style="color:#7f8c8d"><em>On left: First taste of train rides in India.
