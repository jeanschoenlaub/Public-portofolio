        Riples is full stack application web application that merges social networking and project management concept for personal usage. Develloping this app involved:
        Transforming the initial concept into a functional web app through coding and UI/UX design and testing.
        Learning and deploying a full-stack application for web development including CI/CD, authentification...
        Embedding AI including agents with authororisations to conduct actions on users behalfs.
        Developing Riples was a journey in innovation, challenging my technical and creative skills to produce a platform that empowers collaboration and idea realization.
