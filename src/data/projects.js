I lived in Sydney for about 18 months, had amazing flatmates, and worked at a solar start-up called "5B." Life was good. But after four incredible years in Australia, the itch to explore returned.      </p>     <p></br>       Fast-forward to Sunday evening. After bidding adieu to my friends with a pretty hilarious hippy-themed farewell party, we gathered for one final dinner with my flatmates. Leaving behind the warm memories we created in our Maroubra "House of the Rising Sun," I hit the road. First stop: Canberra, a mere three hours south of Sydney, where I slept before making my way to Geelong to catch a ferry to Tasmania the next day.     </p></br>      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">       <div style="text-align: center;">         <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/day1-1.jpeg" alt="Parliament House" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"  class="responsive-image" >         <p style="font-style: italic;">Sunrise on the Parliament House, Canberra</p>       </div>     </div style="text-align: center;">     <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">       <div>         <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/day1-2.jpeg" alt="Mavericks" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"  class="responsive-image" >         <p style="font-style: italic;">Finding 'Mavericks' 5B solar products at a random petrol station en route to Geelong</p>       </div>     </div>      <p></br>     The real fun began once I reached Tasmania. With no fixed itinerary and after seeing a pretty flat surf forecast, I decided to slowly make my way down the east coast of Tassie, without any specific destinations. The first few days are therefore spent driving, searching for waves in places like Scamander, hiking, and coding (this <a href="https://www.riples.app/about/riples" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">Riples</a> web-app you are reading this on).      </p></br>      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">       <div style="text-align: center;">         <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/day2-1.jpeg" alt="Freycinet" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"  class="responsive-image" >         <p style="font-style: italic;">A Trail that stood out, Freycinet Park</p>       </div>     </div style="text-align: center;">     <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">       <div>         <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/day2-2.jpeg" alt="Car setup" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"  class="responsive-image" >         <p style="font-style: italic;">First-person view of the car setup, in Scamander</p>       </div>      </div>      <p>       I ended up making my way down, quite quickly, as I saw there was a bit of swell hitting Bruny Island, an hour's drive from Hobart, Tasmania's largest city. There, in Cloudy Bay, a surf spot on the south of the island, I managed to get my first good surf in ! Apparently it's the southernmost surf spot of Tasmania, and therefore Australia, so even with the neoprene hood, booties, and gloves on top of my old 4/3 wetsuit, it was still fresh!          </p></br>      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">       <div style="text-align: center;">         <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/day3-1.jpeg" alt="Bruny-surf" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"  class="responsive-image" >         <p style="font-style: italic;"> Uncrowded Surf in Cloudy Bay, Bruny Island </p>       </div>     </div style="text-align: center;">     <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">       <div>       <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/day3-2.jpeg" alt="Bruny-view" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"  class="responsive-image" >       <p style="font-style: italic;"> View of Adventure Bay, Bruny Island </p>       </div>      </div>      <p></br>       I really enjoyed my time on Bruny, and ended up staying 3 nights until I had to make my way to Port Arthur for a 4-day hike, called "Three Capes", which I had pre-booked. The journey was nothing short of remarkable, offering awe-inspiring views and a newfound appreciation for—wait for it—rocks. At the start of the hike, they funnily said: "Well you are all here to see rocks".

It comes from <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4WkD6iQPEMkyT64F1Lxnfo?si=0bc0137aa2204141" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">this podcast</a>, and it's phrased as "follow your heart", but I find the core idea is to embrace spontaneity, which opens up a field of opportunities. I'll give a few personal examples:     </p></br>      <p>       <li> Booking the "Three Capes Hike" on a whim a couple of weeks before leaving for Tassie. Turned out to be the best part + got a 100$ discount a couple of days <b>after booking!</b> It also got me doing a lot of amazing hikes prepping for this one</li>       <li> Met a nurse in a hostel that had been to this "Baker Street festival", which was nearly finished. There was one more event the next weekend which I went to by myself. Turned out to be beautiful music + stargazing with a lot of hobbyist astronomers with great gear, and I continued admiring the dark Tassie sky for the rest of the trip.</li>       <li> Changed course on my planned hike of Mount Wellington and arrived at the top exactly when it cleared up (+ got to see the snow which made me think of home) </li>     </p>      <p><br/>     The point of these examples is not to show that by some magic because I took unexpected decisions I was rewarded, but rather that by listening to an inner voice I opened up the field of opportunities. And the fact that these were quite outside of my "normal" opens up even more opportunities!      Anyway I think you get the idea, and to put things in perspective, I will acknowledge that at the NOCTURNA festival, it started with 2 hrs of pretty average scientific talks and I nearly left !)     </p><br/>      <p style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold;"> Conclusion </p>          <p><br/>     From the lakes framed by mountainous backdrops to the countless hiking trails and beautiful skies, Tasmania has been an absolute blast (even though I was pretty unlucky with the surf). I would like to finish up with a call to action for you: try to follow your heart on something(s) these next few weeks. The more out of the ordinary the better !      </p><br/>      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">       <div>       <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/day6-1.jpeg" alt="Thouruoghly enjoying rocks" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"  class="responsive-image" >       <p style="font-style: italic;"> A photo of me thoroughly enjoying rocks :) </p>       </div>     </div>      <p><br/>     PS: Doing a blog post like this is definitly out of my comfort zone / style, and mainly just to showcase the idea of sharing projects on Riples.

        <p id="long-roads-great-times" style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">  Long roads, Great Times </p>  <p>Last fortnight, we had a taste of Tasmania, and it’s majestic rocks. This time around, we will be crossing two more Australian states together, but with a lot more driving involved, as you can probably tell by the map below: </p></br>  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">   <div style="text-align: center;">     <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/day14-1.jpeg" alt="Map of the journey" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image">     <p style="font-style: italic;">The approximate travel itinerary, the orange lines represent the journey from this Riple.</p>   </div> </div> </br>   <p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">  Show Time ! </p>  <p>     I timed the ferry to return me to the mainland with enough spare time to catch some waves and wake those legs up, before having to drive to Lorne (just an hour away). I had booked myself on a trail race about three months back, while planning this trip. Why ? Since my first marathon in Sydney about a year ago, I've been loving endurance sports and trying few different ones to find out which I liked best (my fav so far is the triathlon ! ) </p>   </br>   <p>     The race was a 50km trail, featuring a ridiculous number of waterfalls and river crossings—as high as knee-deep sometimes. It’s pretty weird running with wet sock, but they actually dry out pretty fast, and there is no way around ! No music for the first half; just me, the trail, and the sound of rushing water. What threw me for a loop was the massive climb around the 40k mark. The way up, probably around 500 meters, was actually fine because I just walked it — but it turned into a death run for my legs on the way down. Plus the race organizers gifted us a few kms. Advertised as a 50km, it turned out to be a bonus 5km, a good old 10% reverse discount :) </p>  </br>  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">       <div style="text-align: center;">     <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/day14-2.jpeg" alt="Crossing the finish line after 7.5 hours" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image"/>  <p style="font-style: italic;"> Crossing the finish line after 7.5 hrs of stumbling on rocky river beds, walking and some running </p>  	</div>  </div>   </br>   <p>     After barely surviving the race, I reconnected with my friend Casey, a local shaper I met during an unforgettable surf trip in Hawaii four years ago. Check out his work at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/braesurfboards/" target="_blank"  style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">braesurfboards on Instagram</a>. With the waves firing, I fought my heavy legs, and we got amongst it ( I reckon the cold water helped recovery !!). Oh, and post-surf saunas? Absolutely incredible.   </p>   </br> <p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;"> Crossing the Nullarbor! </p>     <p>     Life was good in Victoria, but as I wanted to make my way to Margaret River pretty fast, I left after a couple of magical days. En route, I encountered some astonishingly remote surf spots, learning locals in South Australia don't think twice about driving hours for a good wave. No surf photos to share though, as I got too excited and jumped straight in every time (and the spots are often quite a bit of a paddle away). Instead, enjoy this one:   </p>  </br>   <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">       <div style="text-align: center;">  <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/day14-4.jpeg" alt=“Kangaroo” style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image"/><p style="font-style: italic;"> Not a bad lifestyle ! Kangoos chilling around Halls Gap, between Melbourne and Adelaide </p>  </div> </div>   </br>   <p>     With the last famous surf spot, “Cactus” taking me right to the beginning of the infamous Nullarbor road, I got a few good last sessions in before the long drive. The Nullarbor is fascinatingly barren; the name literally means "no trees," although you'll find a few stubborn ones. But really it is pretty much just dirt, low vegetation and road, including a no-turns road for 130km ( and not just like no turn-of  -we are talking 1100k without turn-offs, but straight 130km line! Armed with 30 liters of water and tons food, I ventured forth.

For the next couple of days, this will be home. I’ll leave you with this view from the back of my car—a car that, quite frankly, I wasn't sure would make the road, but I'm ever so grateful it did.   </p>  </br>    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">       <div style="text-align: center;">     <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/day14-7.jpeg" alt="The view in Esperance" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block"; class="responsive-image" />   <p style="font-style: italic;"> By the way this is already in WA, so actually we crossed 3 states in this blog ! </p>  </div></div>   <p style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold;"> Insights </p>   <p>         On top of the journey, I also want to share a secret with you. It’s called consistency, and done well, it will work wonders (not unlike compounding money in the bank, with the current interest rates). The core idea is simple, doing something over and over again, you get really good at it, and progress will stack up eventually. This is what allowed me to run the trail in Lorne ( ie. consistently running in zone 2 for a year, mind you never more than 20k).    </p><p>     The secret is in the how you do it, especially for things you might enjoy less, like writing this blog for me ;). The key is to turn the desired action (eg. Writing) into a habit. My top three tips for this are: </p> <p><li> 📅 Schedule it with reminders (eg. every second Sunday, alarm and notifications to write and post a blog). </li> <li> 👁️ Have a visual cue for the habit ( eg. every time I am coding this app I see my last blog post, and I am reminded I better start thinking about what to write next). </il> <li> 🗣️ Tell your friends about it to have social accountability. ( I have told a few of my friends I will keep writing this !) </li> </p> </br> <p>You get the idea, but if you want to dive deeper, I recommend James Clear’s book “Atomic Habit”. On this note, get out there, and let’s all compound together :)</p>,
        <p id="western-australia-waters" style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Western Australia Waters</p> <p>     For this last leg of the Oz road trip, I had designated 3 weeks around the Margaret River area. Indeed, since I first stepped foot in Australia, I've dreamt of surfing here, and it was worth kind of rushing the first part of the journey ! </p><br>  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">     <div style="text-align: center;">         <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/part3-0.jpeg" alt="Map of Australia Adventures" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image">         <p style="font-style: italic;">The approximate travel itinerary, the orange lines represent the journey from this Riple.</p>     </div> </div><br>  <p>      From Denmark to Margaret River, think of vast, uninterrupted beaches with myriad options. The picturesque Gracetown and the iconic Mainbreak at Margaret River were clear highlights.

When asked if I feel like I'm missing out on my trip, my answer has layers. True, I could explore more if solely dedicated to travel, but it’s also super fun to combine working and travelling. You get to see cool places before and after 9-5 working sessions, and with the freedom to tailor my schedule around the surf and weather, I never feel like I am missing out. Apart from the kind of subpar work setup (cramped in the back of the car, or libraries), I have nothing to complain about !</p> <br> <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">     <div style="text-align: center;">         <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/part3-3.jpeg" alt="Man's best rock friend, Albany WA" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image">         <p style="font-style: italic;">Man's best rock friend, next to Laundromat in Albany WA (yes, I also have to do my chores …)</p><br>        <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/part3-4.jpeg" alt="Hike view" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image">         <p style="font-style: italic;">Should I work from here?

Firstly, I shared a first version of Riples, and that got me super excited at first, but then left me in the “Trough of Sorrow”. But adversity fuels me, whether in sports, learning, or other pursuits (also to balance emotional swings, I can’t recommend meditation enough). So I got a massive boost of energy and determination, from the feeling that the Riples start-up idea is an impossible mission (and it may well be !).  </p><br>  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">     <div style="text-align: center;">         <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/part3-5.jpeg" alt="YC peak and trough startup" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image">         <p style="font-style: italic;">Paul Graham’s startup curve concept</p>     </div> </div><br>  <p>     Secondly, Ideas are powerful and that this one is taking me for a ride. I am super excited with the numerous facets of Riples project hosting concept, always eager to build and shape it further, always refining the Idea. So much so that in my final two weeks in Australia, almost everything took a backseat to surfing and Riples, even selling my car and planning my subsequent Indonesia adventure (all those side things turned out allright in the end !). Also, a side observation: I'm discerning striking parallels between entrepreneurship and creative endeavours (creating something people enjoy, thinking outside the box…) </p><br>  <p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Just in time reading</p> <p>     In the previous Riple, I delved into the wonders of habits. Among all, reading holds a special place for me (shoutout to Goodreads for being a stellar reading list app). Lately, I've adopted a different approach to reading, termed by others as “Just in time reading". The crux is to synchronize your reading choices with your predominant thoughts at the moment. Contemplating travel? Dive into Sylvain Tesson's writings. Deciphering marketing for disruptive products? "Crossing the Chasm" by Geoffrey Moore awaits. If you're in my shoes, building a consumer product that needs regular users, "Hooked" by Eyal Nir is a must-read. </p><br>  <p> Ready to continue our adventure? Our next stop: Indonesia. Until then, ride the wave of inspiration and keep exploring! </p>
        <p id="bali-bagus" style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Bali Bagus</p></br><p>Having landed in Bali with little preparation, finding a room for the first night was a fun challenge. I rented a scooter, and after checking three hostels/homestays, the fourth one had availability for a night. Fortunately, after that initial hiccup, I met up with my friend Nik, who had been in Indonesia for two months and was familiar with all the hotspots. Some highlights included a fantastic homestay and co-working space, wonderful Warungs (Indonesian style buffets), and the legendary Uluwatu wave.</p></br> </br>            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">                <div style="text-align: center;">                    <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/fa5082c4-112a-467c-bfb2-1e77e97e1f83" alt="Uploaded Image" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image">                    <p style="font-style: italic;">Temples in our Homestay, much better than the first night one ! </p>                </div>            </div></br></br>            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">                <div style="text-align: center;">                    <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/e2235435-9b6e-4dee-9c06-84ec5542d5a0" alt="Uploaded Image" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image">                    <p style="font-style: italic;">Fueling the brain !

The picturesque journey from Bali to Sumbawa, which involved taking the scooter on two ferries, gave me a unique peek into rural Indonesia. I cherished moments like eating rice from paper cones with my hands on a ferry and and refueling .</p></br> </br>            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">                <div style="text-align: center;">                    <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/0b21a221-344a-4fdc-ad2f-fe59e6153d30" alt="Uploaded Image" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image">                    <p style="font-style: italic;">The scooter setup</p>                </div>            </div></br>                </br>            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">                <div style="text-align: center;">                    <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/fe05e827-f24e-44bd-a4e6-decf80a82087" alt="Uploaded Image" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image">                    <p style="font-style: italic;">The journey.

The traffic on these densely populated islands, coupled with overtaking trucks and potholes, kept me constantly alert. On the way to Sumbawa, after discussing with Nik, I chose to surf Desert Point during the peak of the swell. On the first day, I needed to navigate to this remote location, about a two-hour scooter ride from the ferry. To add to the adventure, the ferry, delayed by the swell, arrived at sunset. This meant I had to tackle the treacherous road to the Desert at night with my heavily laden 100cc Honda Scooby. An unforgettable experience indeed!</p></br></br>            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">                <div style="text-align: center;">                    <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/c944ef5a-65bd-4e67-bb49-730d1cbedeb4" alt="Uploaded Image" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image">                    <p style="font-style: italic;">Road to Desert.

Although I woke up at 6 AM, I only mustered the courage to enter the water at 9:30, fearing the razor-sharp reef at low tide. The ensuing days provided surfing sessions that will forever remain etched in my memory, having witnessed the most awe-inspiring barrels. While I do wish I had arrived a day earlier to bolster my confidence for that initial session, those three days at Desert Point made the waves in Sumbawa seem like a breeze!</p></br>  </br>            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">                <div style="text-align: center;">                    <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/f4e10413-89cc-461b-bd7c-44884d7dad39" alt="Uploaded Image" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image">                    <p style="font-style: italic;">Sucky barrels at Desert Point, Lombok. </p>                </div>            </div></br><p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">A Slice of Paradise in Sumbawa</p></br><p>Upon reaching Sumbawa, the pace of life became delightfully relaxed. In contrast to the hustle and bustle of Bali, and the crazy waves of desert point, Sumbawa offered tranquility. For the first time, I could go for a run, a task impossible amidst the chaotic traffic of Bali and Lombok. But the most enchanting aspect was the stunning vista that accompanied my work. This blend of work amidst nature provided a welcome deviation from the usual routine.</p></br></br>            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">                <div style="text-align: center;">                    <img src="https://riples-public-images-08453786.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/riple-images/ef45480d-a807-48ce-b827-d034addb4f5f" alt="Uploaded Image" style="width: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" class="responsive-image">                    <p style="font-style: italic;">The view from Merdeka House, Sumbawa</p>                </div>            </div></br><p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Conclusion:</p></br><p>From co-working hubs to quaint villages and magnificent landscapes, Indonesia is filled with treasures for intrepid travelers and surfers.
