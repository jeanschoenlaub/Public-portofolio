# A simple portofolio with React elements, some svg animations using FramerMotion, json data and S3 for images, deployed on Vercel

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

If you want to reuse this portofolio template, you can:
 - Change the json data under src/data. (I'm unsing inline HTML for some parts).
 - Change your resume file and favicon under /public
 - Change to hosting images under local or setup your own S3 instance and remember to allow CORS.
 - Potantially Change svg and animations under src/components/drawing.

If you fork this repository you can host on Vercel very easily. 

Feel free to reach out for any questions :)
