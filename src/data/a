<p>Working for a manufacturing solar start-up, I pitched and then executed the development of a data warehouse (technically more a central database than a data warehouse) to store & leverage business and product data from factory to field, for two distinct business cases.</p>

<p>The project entailed creating data pipelines from 5B’s Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software (Odoo), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software (Salesforce), as well as project planning, and field reporting software into Amazon Web Services (AWS). After the daily Extract Transform Load (ETL) pipelines to S3, the data was stored in a single PostgreSQL database and served to customers (internal only) via dashboards, reports, and SQL queries access for more in-depth data analysis.</p>

<p id="context" style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Challenges</p>

<p>This project wasn’t without its challenges. For example, to understand and query the ERP data effectively was tough, as we were using Odoo, an open-source ERP, with a lot of customization. For example, I remember struggling for a while on SQL queries to link each component of a 4 level BoM to Purchase Orders and Transfer Orders, through inventories and Production Orders (to have supplier traceability through individual products).</p>

<p>Another challenge was that I had to wear a lot of different hats on this project, such as doing database architecture, data analysis for reports and dashboards, cloud and data engineering to setup AWS and various pipelines, all tasks I wasn’t familiar with, while managing and teaching an intern. The way I solved this challenge, was to make clear to all stakeholders that this project was a POC, maintaining a constant bi-monthly schedule for releases, and reaching out to other employees about any similar experience they might have had.</p>

<p id="context" style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Project Outcome</p>

<p>In the end, after 6 months of work (at 50% FTE) from myself, and a skilled intern on this Proof of Concept (POC), the product leaders decided to continue this project and I helped hire a replacement for my role that could do so. We had managed to launch four live dashboards (Sales, Supply Chain, Company-Wide, and Executive). Orchestrated data ingestion from four distinct pipelines, including two external SaaS sources, leading to 20+ tables and 100+ data points updated daily.</p>
