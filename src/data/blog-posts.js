       <p>So I decided to develop a video game ! It&rsquo;s a pretty exciting artistic journey that I&rsquo;m happy to share with you. In this first blog post, I will go over the context of this project, share some of the early prototype with you and give you some insights into what the game development process looks like, including some novel AI workflows.</p><p><strong>Some context and background before we get gaming:</strong></p><p>Currently on a gap year, I am both trying out some side project ideas I have accumulated over the years and travelling the world from Australia to Europe. I spent the first 3 months working on a collaborative social media platform idea, Riples. But soon I realised that I wasn&rsquo;t passionate enough about that industry, leading me to the tough decision to step away from Riples.</p><p>As I was winding down that project and looking for the next thing to work on, I realised that I needed to work on something challenging, closer to my passions, and where I could learn new skills. And that&rsquo;s when the idea of making games about sustainability came about, hitting the sweet spot I had been searching for: a blend of innovation, learning, and purpose.</p><p><strong>The approach:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You might not be aware, but the journey of crafting a video game by yourself, known in the industry as indie game development, is actually pretty hard. Not only do you need, as a single person, to come up with the mechanics of the game, but there is also the coding, visual arts,&nbsp;soundscapes,&nbsp;and marketing. To top it off, you are competing against the big studio&rsquo;s blockbuster games such as Assassin&rsquo;s creed, League of Legends, or GTA (also called AAA, pronounced &ldquo;triple-A&rdquo;, games), and a horde of other super talend indie developers.</p><p>And not being a talented artist, nor having much experience with game development (though I have played a lot in the past), I needed to find a good strategy to compete with these talented folks. The idea is to explore the niche of educational games, as I think I am a decent teacher and believe learning through play has a bright future. Put another way, instead of competing on making the best game in existing trendy categories, specialise in the underserved and close to my heart sub-genre of educational games. Finaly, before getting started, I needed to set some rules for myself, as to not get lost in the void of video game making and come back a year later with nothing to show for it. So the rules for my first game Wattwars, are:</p><ol>	<li>Develop a playable prototype in a month, and assess engagement from it.</li>	<li>Innovate only on the educational aspect, copy a lot for the rest.</li>	<li>Among the new skills, focus most on marketing (partly because it is a big weakness of mine but also the most transferable skills).</li></ol><p>And that&rsquo;s how, armed with this simple rulebook, l dove in to the fun part, taking the educational sustainbality concept to a first iteration.</p><p><strong>The first iteration:</strong></p>
